## Possibilities

#### Quantum Computing 
  - Design comparisons/implementations of CC design patterns/logical operations on QC, with a pedagogical goal in mind
     - Design Patterns in QC - too ambitious?
     - Low level logical operations - already extensively covered?
     - What is the sweet spot?
  - Alternative: analyse [Qiskit's](https://qiskit.org/) architetucture

#### Rust / Scala / [OOP language that has typeclasses]
  - Approach commons design problems and implement them
  - By relying solely on [typeclasses](https://medium.com/@olxc/type-classes-explained-a9767f64ed2c) instead of the "OOP way"
  
####  Pony
  - Approach common design problems and implement them
  - As Pony is OOP based, we can start from common patterns and approach the problems they're trying to solve
